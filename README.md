## 🌀 What is Swaply?

**Swaply** is a smart, peer-to-peer coupon trading platform that lets users swap, negotiate, and balance the value of their unused coupons in real time.

---

## 💡 Why Swaply?

Every day, thousands of coupons go unused — locked into wallets, emails, and receipts. Swaply changes that by creating a **live coupon economy**, where users can:

- 🔁 **Trade** their unused coupons with others nearby or online.
- 💬 **Negotiate** in real-time through chat-based interactions.
- ⚖️ **Balance value** by combining multiple coupons or adding tokens.
- 🤝 **Match intelligently** with users who want what you have.
- 🛡️ **Stay secure** with a system designed to reduce fraud.

---

## 🌐 The Vision

Swaply isn’t just an app — it’s a **coupon revolution**.

We imagine a world where coupons are:
- Fluid
- Valuable
- Social

No more wasting. No more expiration regrets. Just smart, meaningful exchanges.
