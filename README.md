## 🌍 What is Swaply?

**Swaply** is a peer-to-peer coupon exchange platform built to **reclaim the value of unused coupons**. Think of it as a smart, social wallet — where **you don’t lose your deals, you trade them**.

Whether it’s an unused food coupon, a discount from an online store, or a promo code that doesn’t fit your current need — Swaply connects you to someone who *wants* it, and helps you get what *you* want in return.
